United Stated saw an increase in women in the workplace since 1930 and 1970 it this increase continues (1). Nevertheless, payment inequality in different work sectors remains a big issue but stigma around working married women in the US has reduced (1). The recent movie "Picture a Scientist" highlight that although the stigma have reduce, the discrimination against women in the workplace has not (2).

The descrimination against female names in applications does not even account for the discrimination either sexual or gender bases that many women face once that they are hired. And unfortanetlly many countries doesn't have laws that proctec women in the workplace. Also, many countries doesn't have equality when referring to education.

In many countries the still a high level of stigma of women being in the workplace. The World Bank showed that 15 countries with less women in the workplace belong Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in 2015 (3). Despite that in many cases females were outperforming their male counterparts (3). The patriarcal society in this countries and the lack of rules that protect women in the workplaces not only towards harrasment but for equal payment is pushing women out of the workforce if they even get the job. According to El-Swais article Morocco from these counties is the only one that by 2015 had laws again gender discrimination during hiring and equal payment, while Algeria joined later with equal payment (3).
