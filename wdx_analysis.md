# The increase of women in the workplace drives an increase in GDP

**Author**: Shaimar R. González Morales

**Date**: 3/28/2021

United Stated saw an increase in women in the workplace since 1930 and 1970 it this increase continues (1). Nevertheless, payment inequality in different work sectors remains a big issue but stigma around working married women in the US has reduced (1). The recent movie "Picture a Scientist" highlight that although the stigma have reduce, the discrimination against women in the workplace has not (2). In the movie it showcase a study that was performed where a women can submit a CV or resume with the same credentials than man but the male always recieved better feedback than the female applicant (2).

The descrimination against female names in applications does not even account for the discrimination either sexual or gender bases that many women face once that they are hired. And unfortanetlly many countries doesn't have laws that proctec women in the workplace. Also, many countries doesn't have equality when referring to education.

In many countries the still a high level of stigma of women being in the workplace. The World Bank showed that 15 countries with less women in the workplace belong Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in 2015 (3). Despite that in many cases females were outperforming their male counterparts (3). The patriarcal society in this countries and the lack of rules that protect women in the workplaces not only towards harrasment but for equal payment is pushing women out of the workforce if they even get the job. According to El-Swais article Morocco from these counties is the only one that by 2015 had laws again gender discrimination during hiring and equal payment, while Algeria joined later with equal payment (3).

El-Sawais said that these gap between male and female in the workplace produce a 27% loss in income in these countries. 

I utilized some of the data from World Bank to explore the percentage of women in the workforce in countries of highest GDP and compare with some countries with low women in the workforce to determine if is seems to be a trend. This is very important not only to help increase the women workforce in other countries but also in increase equity in the workplace especially in the STEM fields. Women unfortuantely due to the recent pandemic have suffer more due to deal with child care as most of daycare were close or not safe during this pandemic. We know that the economy have suffer during the pandemic but how much will be because women were force to stay taking care of the children affecting their work productivity. 

Although this database doesn't include data we can see how other countries when they increase the percentage of women even if is slighthy if that contribute to a higher GDP. The data is obtained from http://www.worlddev.xyz/ which allow to visualize current data from the World Bank in a way that is more accessible. 


First, to performed this analysis I chose Economy and Growth with GDP per capita (cureent international $) and Education labor force total. The countries that were selected were Algeria, Canada, China, Egypt, Germany, India, Iran, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, United States and Yemen from 2010 to 2019.

Here in this graph we can observed that United States, Germany and Canada has the higher GDP  and the lowest are Yemen and India.

I used a buble graph to ilustrate the relation between GDP and women workforce.

 In this graph we can observed that New Zealand have a high women workforce than many countries. Nevertheless, United States and China are the countries with higher women workforce. We know that China increase in female workforce could be due to their one child policy and perhaps more favorable work evironments than other Asian countries in this list. Nevertheless we observed that Yemen, India and Iran are among the lowest in women workforce and lower GDP. We can observed that with exception than Saudi Arabia more women in the workforce correlates with more GDP.

 In this line graph we can observed how there GDP have been growing over the years. And when we look back to Saudi Arabia we ca observed that their GDP have decrease. Not necesarily in this case due to less women in the workplace but probably due to the oil industry taking some hit. Nevertheless, if we look at New Zealand their GDP have slightly increase.
 
 I did a search to what happened during this time that their was an increase in the economy as also there was an increase in women in the workplace (4). I found that during this time there was plan put into place that help women get into jobs like construction and other reforms that help women enter the workforce (4). If the US and other countries follow the lead of New Zealand there can even be buster in the economy. This is not only about more people working equal more profits but is also more ideas, which equals more innnovation.
 
 The Growing Economies Through Gender Parity established a projectio of what could happend if countries adop gender parity in the workforce and how that will be observed in terms of GDP increase.

In this article we observed that althought US are 75% of gender parity there still much to be done and we should adopt policies the ones in New Zealand to potentially also boost the economy (5). If the US adopt New Zealand strategies there will be an increase of even 12% which is 2.7 trillion gain and around $8,000 per person (5). 

Therefore, let's support women in the workplace and create an equal environment for everyone. At the end this will benefit everyone of us.
